# Data Analytics Project: Customer Insights Dashboard

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable insights delivered through an interactive dashboard and presentation. The pipeline includes data loading and cleaning in Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based querying on relational databases, and visualization using Power BI.

The goal is to showcase practical analytics skills used in real-world business decision-making.

## Dataset

* Source: Structured customer/business dataset (CSV format)
* Size: Medium-scale (suitable for SQL + BI analysis)
* Contents include:

  * Customer attributes
  * Transactional or behavioral metrics
  * Time-based and categorical variables

The dataset is first processed in Python and then stored in a relational database for analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**: Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

  * Libraries: Pandas
* **SQL**: Data querying and aggregation

  * Databases: PostgreSQL
* **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma**: Final presentation and reporting
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Analysis and documentation

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Handle missing values
   * Correct data types
   * Remove duplicates and inconsistencies

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Distribution analysis
   * Trend and pattern identification
   * Key metric exploration

3. **Database Integration**

   * Load cleaned data into SQL database
   * Write optimized SQL queries for insights

4. **Dashboard Development**

   * Connect Power BI to SQL database
   * Build dynamic visuals and KPIs
   * Enable filtering and drill-down analysis

5. **Reporting**

   * Summarize insights
   * Create a professional presentation using Gamma

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis across time
* Customer segmentation views
* Interactive filters for deeper analysis

Designed for **business users and decision-makers**.
